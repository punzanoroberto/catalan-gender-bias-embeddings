# catalan-gender-bias-embeddings

## Overview
This project investigates **gender bias in Catalan word embeddings**. The goal is to analyze how adjectives associated with masculine and feminine pronouns are represented in a distributional semantic space. It also aims at quantify potential bias. The analysis combines **quantitative metrics (cosine similarity, Spearman correlation, bias scores)** with **linguistically-informed qualitative visualizations**. This project was developed as part of my MSc in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics for the Computational Semantics course at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.

## Dataset
The study uses a list of Catalan adjectives paired with masculine and feminine pronouns. Adjectives are categorized into five semantic groups:  

1. **Professional Abilities**  
2. **Personality**  
3. **Physical Aspect**  
4. **Interpersonal and Social Abilities**  
5. **Creativity**

## Embeddings
We used **FastText Catalan embeddings** (`cc.ca.300.vec.gz`) with 300-dimensional vectors. It was loaded using `gensim` and limited to the first 100,000 words for computational efficiency. Embeddings represent distributional semantics and are used to calculate cosine similarity between adjectives and pronouns.

## Methods
1. **Quantitative Analysis**
Cosine similarity was applied between each adjective and its respective pronoun (`ell` for masculine, `ella` for feminine). Spearman correlation between masculine-pronoun and feminine-pronoun similarities was used. Finally, bias score was computed (similarity with `ell` − similarity with `ella`).  

2. **Qualitative / Visual Analysis**  
Scatter plots were created for overall and per-group adjective similarities. Likewise, bar plots of bias scores were plotted, highlighting masculine-biased (`ell`) and feminine-biased (`ella`) adjectives. We also applied an outlier detection and visualization of adjectives with the strongest bias.  

The combination of metrics and visualizations allows a **linguistically-informed interpretation** of gender representation in embeddings.

## Results
The **Spearman correlation** between masculine-pronoun and feminine-pronoun similarities is **ρ ≈ 0.717**, wich indicated a moderate positive relationship. Bias scores identify adjectives that are more closely associated with either `ell` (masculine bias) or `ella` (feminine bias). Visualization highlights both general trends and outliers, showing where embeddings reinforce gender associations.  

## Reproducibility
All steps are documented in the notebook: `catalan_gender_bias_analysis.ipynb` Output tables and figures can be regenerated by running the notebook from start to finish.  

## Limitations & Future Work
Limited size of adjective lists and embeddings subset (100k words) may restrict coverage.  Future work could include larger corpora, contextual embeddings, or should address attention-based analyses to detect subtler biases.
